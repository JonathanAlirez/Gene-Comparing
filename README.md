# Gene-Comparing
Compare 2 DNA strands (random and actual)

#Use
```
Java GeneMain
```

#Thoughts on Speed
This is a very fast gene comparing application. It is able to handle an huge ammount of chars and compute them very efficiently.
It can write, solve, and compare 6 billion individual DNA bases together in under 20 seconds.
```
How many DNA sequences to write: 30000000
Started at: 6:01:27 PM
DNA Strand 1 has been created... : 3 seconds
DNA Strand 2 has been created... : 4 seconds
DNA Strand 1 has been turned into amino acid pairs : 2 seconds
DNA Strand 2 has been turned into amino acid pairs : 2 seconds
DNA Strand 1 is being compared to DNA Strand 2...
Compare complete! : 5 seconds
Complete in: 19 seconds @ 6:01:46 PM
```

#Thoughts for Further Development
I plan to make this program even more robust in the future. I want to make it so it can compare if where the individual strands
and amino acid pairs coincide, to have more understanding on what it is that is being put in. I would also like to make it
so that the user can have an accurate guess on what is they are looking at.
